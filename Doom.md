max_steps = 5000              # Max possible steps in an episode
batch_size = 64

# FIXED Q TARGETS HYPERPARAMETERS
max_tau = 10000 #Tau is the C step where we update our target network

# EXPLORATION HYPERPARAMETERS for epsilon greedy strategy
explore_start = 1.0            # exploration probability at start
explore_stop = 0.01            # minimum exploration probability
decay_rate = 0.00005            # exponential decay rate for exploration prob

# Q LEARNING hyperparameters
gamma = 0.95               # Discounting rate

### MEMORY HYPERPARAMETERS
## If you have GPU change to 1million
pretrain_length = 100000   # Number of experiences stored in the Memory when initialized for the first time
memory_size = 100000       # Number of experiences the Memory can keep
